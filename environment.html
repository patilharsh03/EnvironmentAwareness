      <p>
        Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our
        environment and the importance of its protection. Promoting
        environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental
        steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.

      <h1 style="margin-top: 5px">What is Environmental Awareness?</h1>
      <p>
        To define environmental awareness we must first understand the
        environmentalist movement. Environmentalism is an ideology that evokes
        the necessity and responsibility of humans to respect, protect, and
        preserve the natural world from its anthropogenic (caused by humans)
        afflictions. Environmental awareness is an integral part of the
        movementâ€™s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical
        environment is fragile and indispensable, we can begin fixing the
        problems that threaten it.

      <h1 style="margin-top: 5px">Examples of Environmental Issues</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Oil Drilling</b> - This issue is one that causes a great deal of
        environmental destruction. Our dependence on fossil fuel is a global
        addiction that affects every aspect of the world. Oil spills and
        offshore drilling poison marine life, oil drilling (on land) suffocates
        the earth, and the combustion of fossil fuels add to the increased
        atmospheric COâ‚‚, which in turns causes the progression of global warming
        and ocean acidification. This is a multifaceted issue and is a good
        cause to get involved with because it covers such a broad spectrum of
        issues.
        <br />
        <b>Production of Plastic Goods</b> - Currently our society creates a
        great deal of waste and much of that waste consists of plastic.
        According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010 alone 31
        million tons of plastic waste was created. This waste ends up all over
        the globe in both land and water, a good example is the Great Pacific
        Garbage Patch. Not only is plastic waste an issue, but the production of
        plastic is also dependent on fossil fuel combustion. According to the
        U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2010 191 million barrels
        of liquid petroleum gases(LPG) and natural gas liquids (NGL) were used
        in the U.S. alone to produce plastic goods. Landfill waste
